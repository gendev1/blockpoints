# Blockpoints 
Block Points is a plug in SDK for DeFi applications that allows developers to add points to the users of their application. The points can be used to reward users for their activity on the platform, or to incentivize them to take certain actions. The points can be redeemed for rewards, or used to access premium features on the platform. Block Points is built on the Ethereum blockchain, and uses smart contracts to manage the points system.
